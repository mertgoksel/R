## Set the seed and initialize vectors
```{r}
set.seed(303)
x1 <- rgamma(1000, shape = 1.5, scale = .5)
x2 <- rgamma(5000, shape = 1.5, scale = .5)
```

## Define negative loglikelihood function for gamma
```{r}
gamma_loglik <- function(parm,X){ 
    alpha <- parm[1] 
    beta <- parm[2] 
    loglik <- sum(dgamma(X, shape=alpha, scale=beta, log=TRUE)) 
    return(-loglik) 
}
```

## Optimize for x1
```{r, warning=FALSE}
nlm(gamma_loglik, p = c(1,1), X = x1)
```

## Optimize for x2
```{r, warning=FALSE}
nlm(gamma_loglik, p = c(1,1), X = x2)
```

We see that more observations yield better estimations as these are done via 
approximations. We know that the parameters are 1.5 & 0.5, and both results 
are satisfactory. Rounding both to 1st digit yields the same results. But x2 
has more precision becuase size is bigger.
